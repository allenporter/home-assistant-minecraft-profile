# homeassistant-minecraft-profile

Home Assistant Custom Component for displaying minecraft profile information
and skins. It also supports pulling information from Hypixel.

The Minecraft Profile Image platform uses the [Mojang API](https://wiki.vg/Mojang_API)
to query skins for they player, and renders the skin as an image entity.

The [Hypixel API](https://api.hypixel.net/) requires a developer key.
